# 5G Network Slicing Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains a Python simulation of network slicing in 5G networks, demonstrating AI-driven optimization for resource allocation and traffic management. The simulation compares the performance of a traditional system and an AI-driven system in terms of bandwidth utilization over time.

## Features
- Dynamic resource allocation based on traffic patterns.
- Comparison between traditional and AI-driven optimization approaches.
- Simulation of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), and massive machine-type communication (mMTC).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: `matplotlib`, `numpy`

## How to Run the Simulation
1. **Install Python (3.7 or higher):**  
   Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Required Libraries:**  
   Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib numpy
Run the Simulation:
Execute the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python network_slicing_simulation.py
View Output:
The script generates a plot comparing the bandwidth utilization of traditional and AI-driven systems over time.
